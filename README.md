# lv-hal
OOP Hardware abstraction library that supports loading from disk at runtime and a unified configuration interface.

#Setup
To get the HAL and editor working follow these steps:

 1. Open lv-hal.lvproj and build the "PPL" build spec. This will output to ../build/ppl relative to the folder containing the project
 
 2. Open lv-hal-config.lvproj and build the "HAL Editor" build spec. This will output to ../build/bin relative to the project folder.
